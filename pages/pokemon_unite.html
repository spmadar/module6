            <p>Pokémon Unite is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game developed by TIMI Studios and published by The Pokémon Company. The game draws inspiration from traditional Pokémon games, featuring familiar elements such as held items and in-game items like Potions, X Speed, and X Attack. However, it also introduces unique theory crafting with emblem loadouts that offer different benefits, such as increased HP (white emblems) or more attack power (orange emblems).</p>

            <p>My favorite Pokémon to play as is Absol due to its exceptional mobility, burst damage, and ability to pierce through the 'squishy' backline of Attack Damage Carries (ADCs). The game is often compared to League of Legends, but unlike its notoriously toxic community, TIMI Studios has implemented measures to reduce in-game negativity. Despite this, the game's US player base often demonstrates questionable decision-making, and the developers seem to be focusing more on the Chinese version of the game.</p>

            <p>Despite the frustrations with the developer neglect and the player base, Pokémon Unite remains my go-to choice for a MOBA. Its strategic depth, fast-paced gameplay, and addictiveness of pulling off the perfect play make it an endlessly entertaining experience for me.</p>
